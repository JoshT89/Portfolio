        <h1>Hello everybody and welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
<h3>My name is Joshua Turner and this year I decided to improve my life dramatically.</h3>
<div>
    <p>Have you ever just been sat at your desk at work after a long day of doing the same thing you did the previous 4 days of the week and thought "I'm not sure I want to do this for another 30years until I retire". 
    If your answer is yes then I believe you will find this portfolio very relatable and hopefully inspire you to make a change too.</p>
</div>
        <div>
            <p>A very good friend of mine who trained himself to be a senior Back-End Developer in just 6 years, now is able to work remotley from anywhere in the world while earning a very respectable salary.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>I realised coding would be perfect for me for 3 main reasons:</h3>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first reason and most important reason for me is, there is always something new to learn, coding is literally endless learning and learning something new everyday 
                        makes me enjoy my work. You know what they say "if you enjoy your work, are you really working?".
                    </li>
                    <li>The second reason is flexibility. As most roles are hybrid or purely remote working there is the option to travel abit, obviously not too far from the country you work in Ha!.
                        This allows a change of scenery and new adventures for outside of work, which gives me a chance to see more of the world and clench my need for adventure and meeting new people.
                    </li>
                    <li>The third most important reason is, I've always wanted to have my own fitness and wellbeing app. Having battled through anxiety myself, I'd like to help others and soon I will be
                        able to create a free app in my spare time and achieve this goal myself. This would put my satisfaction level at about 10,000 Ha!.   
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

    <section id="about">
        <h1>This section is just all about me, from special moments in my life I'm happy to share, to my favourite foods and music.</h1>
        <p>So it all began back in May 1989 when I was born in Milton Keynes but bred in Gozo I've sadly been told "shivers". My parents owned a resturant in a town called Stony Stratford called Ruby Tuesdays. 
            Sadly they had to let the resturant go and they decided to move to Gozo. I think I was about 2 or 3 years old at this stage but do have alot of memories of living there. 
            One of which was I went to a school which was run by nuns and funnily enough when i came back to Stony Stratford about 3 years later and started in year 1. I had the best spelling, handwriting and grammar so fair play to those nuns.
        </p>
            <div>
                <p>I believe due to being an only child I have always found it easy to make friends anywhere I go, well technically I do have a half sister but she is older and we never lived together,
                     as my parents had me rather late Ha!.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I'm one of the lucky people who actaully enjoyed school especially the later years, so many stories to remember. I got my first job at 14 as a kitchen porter at The Old George in Stony Stratford. 
                    I worked every sunday and earned Â£4 an hour for 6 hours in a very hot and small kicthen, where the Sunday roast spit will be in full rotation and the dish washer was permanently broken as far as i could tell Ha!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>At one point in my life in my early 20s, I was a Personal Trainer and a Snowboard Instructor which were both incredibly fun and rewarding jobs just not finacially Ha! but I did meet the best people.

            <h3>The first time my mental health took a hit. I truly believe you have to experience the lowest lows before you can feel the highest highs</h3>
            <div>
                <p>When i was about 27 my mother was diagnosed with cancer for the second time in just over 20 years. However this time I was alot older and it really hit me. Thankfully and touch wood my mum beat cancer and now is happily retired with my father in a posh little town near Peterborough.
                    However I couldn't stop thinking about the next threat that was coming for me and my family even after my mum got the all clear. The best way to describe it was my brain was stuck in a hyperresponse mode constantly on the lookout for the next threats, either diseases or accidentscoming for my family.
                    Doctors just wanted to give me pills and the CBT therapist was not at all helpful, which I waited over a year for. This broke me as I thought CBT would be my saving grace. 
                </p>
                    <p>Through a contact from my mother I went to see a self taught therapist called Carmen who changed everything just by listening to me. She told me i wasnt broken and this is normal what i am going through which alone was music to my ears.
                        Something so simple making the biggest difference. I then started a 4 year journey battling my mental health and the hardest place to battle was the workplace. However I am now stronger than ever.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Now I keep myself in check by eating well - my favourite is spaghetti bolognese home made of course, excercising regulary, socialising and keeping the people I love the most, happy. Also the Wim Hof breathing teckers and cold water exposure is incredible! what a feeling it gives you, never felt so alive.
I listen to alot of music now too and at this point today the following are my current top 5:</p>

    <section id="journey">
        <h1>The journey so far.</h1>
        <p>It all started in december 2022 when I had just booked a doctor on a truly incredible position. But despite all my efforts the doctor still found things to negatively email my director directly about. 
            That was the moment that changed my mindset completely and I didnt look back. Recruitment is one of those jobs that the better you get at your job, your job actually becomes tougher and more stressfull as you have many clients to look after. 
            But how could I get similar if not better pay and a much better workign life....</p>
        <div>
<p>I wanted a life like my mate did in Barcelona so I started to look into coding as soon as I got home that night. I quickly found that Front-End allowed me to be creative and watch my work come to life.  
    Plus like I said earlier I love to learn and everyone I had spoke to so far said that coding is a never ending lesson, so I was sold. "The poweres of the universe" must of been aware of my new choice as an amazing deal suddenly appeared on my instagram for 75% off Codecademy pro course!! Can you believe the luck Ha!
Luckily Codecademy was the provide my mate used as well and they had nothing but good reviews and positive videos on youtube</p>
<p>So i dived straight in and by the end of February I handed in my notice and started the course. I'm very lucky that I got on well with my directors who were nothing but supportive and I even still play golf with them now 
</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>As soon as i started the course I was hooked. The time for the course was estimated for 8-12 months but as I wasnt working, I gave it everything I had and passed all the exams and projects within 5 months.
                I really enjoyed the course and how well laid out it was and once I started to see the work come to life on my screen, I knew I made the right choice.  
            </p>
            <p>However I am now at the toughest stage of the course which is finding that first role with no on the job experience and it is a little scary. But nothing will stop me from making this work
                which is why I have created this portfolio to hopefully show off my skills and personailty.
